# FileType Picker - Slide-Out Drawer Specification

## Overview

The FileType Picker is implemented as a **slide-out drawer** that appears above the main action button. It uses a click-to-toggle pattern rather than hover, providing better UX especially on touch devices.

**Design Standard**: All animations must be buttery smooth, satisfying, and modern - using glassy/frosted effects with subtle transparency for a polished feel.

## Architecture

### Component Structure

```
App.tsx (Main Container)
├── FileList (Scrollable)
│   ├── File Items
│   └── "Add More Files" Button (at end of list)
├── Hidden <input type="file">
└── Fixed Bottom Section
    ├── Drawer (Format Selector + Cancel)
    └── Pick Filetype / Convert Button
```

### State Management

- `isDrawerOpen` (boolean): Controls drawer visibility
- `selectedTargetFormat` (FormatId | null): Currently selected format
- `availableTargets` (FormatId[]): Compatible formats for loaded files

## UI Behavior

### Initial State (No Format Selected)

- Button displays: **"Pick filetype"** icon + text
- Button is **enabled** if `availableTargets.length > 0`
- Button is **disabled** only if `availableTargets.length === 0`
- Drawer is hidden (max-height: 0, opacity: 0)

### Opening the Drawer

- User clicks "Pick filetype" button
- `isDrawerOpen` toggles to `true`
- Drawer slides down with 300ms transition
- Drawer contains:
  - `TargetFormatSelector` component (format buttons)
  - "Cancel" button at bottom

### Selecting a Format

- User clicks a format button (e.g., ".png", ".jpg")
- `selectedTargetFormat` is set
- Drawer **automatically closes** via `useEffect` hook
- Button changes to **"Convert"** with rotate icon

### Canceling

- User clicks "Cancel" button in drawer
- `isDrawerOpen` set to `false`
- Drawer slides back up
- No format is selected

### Converting

- User clicks "Convert" button (when format is selected)
- Conversion starts
- Drawer is explicitly closed (`setIsDrawerOpen(false)`)

## Critical Implementation Details

### Button Disabled Logic

**CRITICAL**: The button must be clickable to open the drawer!

```tsx
disabled={availableTargets.length === 0 && !isConverting}
```

**Why this works:**

- When `availableTargets.length > 0` → Button is enabled → Can click to open drawer
- When `selectedTargetFormat` is set → Button is enabled → Can click to convert
- Only disabled when there are NO compatible formats at all

**WRONG Implementation (causes bug):**

```tsx
// DON'T DO THIS - button becomes unclickable when no format selected
disabled={!canConvert && !isConverting && (!availableTargets.length || selectedTargetFormat === null)}
```

### Drawer Animation (Overlay)

```tsx
className={`
  absolute left-0 right-0 bottom-full mb-4 z-50
  transition-all duration-300 ease-out overflow-hidden origin-bottom
  ${isDrawerOpen && !selectedTargetFormat && availableTargets.length > 0
    ? 'max-h-[500px]'
    : 'max-h-0'}
`}
```

- **Absolutely positioned**: `absolute left-0 right-0 bottom-full` positions it as an overlay above the button
- **No document flow impact**: Drawer doesn't push or move the file list when opening/closing
- Uses `max-height` transition (not height) for smooth slide animation
- No opacity transition - purely slides out/in without fading
- `origin-bottom` ensures animation starts from bottom (slides up from button when opening)
- `overflow-hidden` prevents content overflow during animation
- `mb-4` creates spacing between drawer and button (fixed spacing, not conditional)
- `z-50` ensures drawer appears above file list content
- `shadow-lg` adds depth to show it's floating above content
- Parent container must have `relative` positioning
- Drawer only shows if: drawer is open AND no format selected AND targets available

### Auto-Close on Selection

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedTargetFormat) {
    setIsDrawerOpen(false)
  }
}, [selectedTargetFormat])
```

Automatically closes drawer when user selects a format, providing seamless UX.

## Visual Design

### Drawer Container

- Background: `bg-brand-bg-secondary`
- Border: `border border-brand-border`
- Rounded corners: `rounded-brand`
- Padding: `p-4`
- Bottom margin: `mb-4` (space between drawer and button)

### Cancel Button (inside drawer)

- Full width: `w-full`
- Border: `border-brand-border`
- Background: `bg-gray-100 dark:bg-black/20`
- Hover: `hover:bg-gray-200 dark:hover:bg-black/30`
- Top margin: `mt-4` (space from format selector)

### Main Action Button

- Height: `72px` (fixed)
- Blue accent when enabled: `bg-brand-accent hover:bg-brand-accent-hover`
- Gray when disabled: `bg-gray-300/50 dark:bg-gray-700/50`
- Shows "Pick filetype" or "Convert" based on `selectedTargetFormat`

## Integration with FileList

The "Add More Files" button is rendered **inside** `FileList.tsx` at the end of the file list:

```tsx
<FileList onAddFiles={() => fileInputRef.current?.click()} />
```

**Rationale**:

- Keeps "Add more files" contextually with the files
- Maintains consistent width with file items
- Scrolls with the file list
- Simpler layout structure

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Button Disabled Too Early**: Don't disable the button when no format is selected - it needs to be clickable to open drawer
2. **Drawer Doesn't Show**: Check that `availableTargets.length > 0` and targets are being calculated
3. **Hover Issues**: The disabled cursor-blocked was caused by strict disabled logic, not hover states
4. **Width Misalignment**: All elements (FileList, Add Files, Drawer, Button) share same container with `max-width: 630px`
5. **Parent Positioning**: The drawer's parent container must have `position: relative` for absolute positioning to work correctly
6. **Z-Index Issues**: Drawer needs high z-index (z-50) to appear above scrollable file list content

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload files → Button becomes enabled
- [ ] Click "Pick filetype" → Drawer slides up as overlay (doesn't push file list)
- [ ] File list remains stationary when drawer opens/closes
- [ ] Drawer appears above file list with visible shadow
- [ ] Click format → Drawer closes automatically
- [ ] Button shows "Convert" → Click starts conversion
- [ ] Click "Cancel" in drawer → Drawer closes without selection
- [ ] Add more files button appears at end of list
- [ ] All elements have same width (630px max)
