# Concurrent Conversion & Transcoding Warnings

## Overview

Enables simultaneous conversion of multiple files with intelligent quality warnings for lossy-to-lossy audio transcoding.

## Smart Format Detection Requirements

System must detect and categorize audio formats by compression type:

- **Lossy Format Detection**: Identify formats that use lossy compression
- **Lossless Format Detection**: Identify formats that preserve original quality
- **Transcoding Detection**: Detect when converting between incompatible formats
- **Warning Generation**: Provide user-friendly messages about quality implications

### Warning Scenarios

- **Lossy → Lossy**: Critical warning about cumulative quality loss (generation loss)
- **Lossless → Lossy**: Informational notice about intentional compression
- **Lossy → Lossless**: Informational notice that quality cannot be recovered
- **Lossless → Lossless**: No warning (quality preserved)

## Concurrent Processing Architecture

### Requirements

- Multiple files must convert simultaneously, not sequentially
- Each file maintains independent progress tracking
- System resources (CPU, GPU, hardware acceleration) utilized efficiently
- Overall conversion time reduced for batch operations

### Benefits

- **Speed**: Parallel processing reduces total conversion time
- **Efficiency**: Better utilization of multi-core processors
- **User Experience**: Real-time progress for all files simultaneously

## UI Requirements

### File List Display

- **Processing Counter**: Display count of files currently converting
- **Status Summary**: Real-time counts for all file states
- **Individual Progress**: Each file shows its own progress indicator and percentage
- **Status Visualization**: Color-coded indicators with appropriate animations
  - Active processing: Animated indicator
  - Completed: Success indicator
  - Queued: Pending indicator
  - Failed: Error indicator

### Format Selector Warnings

- **Inline Warnings**: Display transcoding warnings when selecting lossy formats
- **Visual Feedback**: Prominent warning display with clear messaging
- **Context-Aware**: Only display warnings relevant to current file selection

## Conversion Flow Requirements

### Core Conversion Logic

- Process multiple files concurrently using parallel execution
- Display transcoding warnings before conversion begins
- Maintain comprehensive error handling for individual file failures
- Track progress independently for each file
- Support both image and audio conversion workflows

## Performance Requirements

- Heavy processing offloaded to background threads (Web Workers)
- Concurrent processing leverages multi-core CPU architecture
- Efficient state management for real-time progress updates
- Proper resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Graceful handling of individual file failures without blocking others
