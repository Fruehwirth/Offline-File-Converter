# Meta Rules & Self-Reflection

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Documentation File Rules

**NEVER CREATE MARKDOWN FILES IN THE PROJECT ROOT DIRECTORY**

- ❌ **FORBIDDEN:** Creating .md files in project root (AUDIO_PREVIEW.md, PERFORMANCE.md, etc.)
- ✅ **REQUIRED:** All documentation, specifications, and knowledge goes in `.cursor/rules/`
  - Use `.cursor/rules/Specifications/` for feature specs
  - Use `.cursor/rules/knowledge/` for implementation knowledge
  - Use `.cursor/rules/special_cases/` for edge cases and patterns
- **Why:** Root directory is for project files only, not AI documentation
- **This is a HIGH PRIORITY rule - violations are unacceptable**

If you need to document something:
1. Create `.mdc` file in appropriate `.cursor/rules/` subdirectory
2. Add YAML frontmatter with description
3. Keep content concise and actionable

## Maintaining These Rules

When updating rules:

- **Be concise**: Avoid redundancies
- **Simplify**: Make clearer and more direct
- **Add useful patterns**: Welcome new insights
- **Keep actionable**: Clear, practical application
- **REALLY sum it up**: Make significantly shorter when rewriting

## Self-Reflection Protocol

After solving a problem (especially multiple failures):

1. **PAUSE**: What worked differently?
2. **Identify key change**: Structure vs CSS vs different tool?
3. **Share insight**: Help user understand
4. **Update mental model**: Remember pattern

## Problem-Solving

When failing repeatedly:

1. **Stop and reassess**: Don't repeat same approach
2. **Question approach**: Root cause analysis
3. **Look broader**: What's structurally different?
4. **Consider restructuring**: DOM change often beats CSS fight
5. **Test incrementally**: One change at a time

## Creating New Rule Files

When creating new knowledge/findings files in `.cursor/rules/`:

- **Include description**: Add YAML frontmatter with concise description of contents and potential use cases
- **Example format**:
  ```yaml

  description: 'Brief what/why/when to use this rule'
